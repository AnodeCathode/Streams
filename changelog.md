- Fixed [timeout in Streams generation](https://github.com/delvr/Streams/issues/74) happening in certain rare terrain shapes. Note that may could result in slightly different shapes for streams compared to previous versions.
- Extended support for [Better With Mods](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bwm-suite/files) waterwheels to versions 2.3.17 and above.
