- Fixed crash due to unreported Farseek dependency errors (requires Farseek 2.1 or later).
- Possibly fixed stone and ice "bridges" over rivers.
- Added block.properties file for enabling Streams river blocks in shaders without manually editing shader files.
- Removed Shader block replacement message when in server mode.
