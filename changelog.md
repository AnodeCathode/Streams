- Improved vanilla and TFC performance (see Farseek changelog).
- Fixed cobblestone and snow river sections with certain worldgen mods such as RTG. (Note: as a side-effect of this change, some worldgen caves that would have opened onto river banks in previous versions no longer do.)
- Possibly fixed stone and ice "bridges" over rivers.
- Fixed missing tree trunks on stream banks in TFC.
- Removed unused RiverIce blocks (will return in v1.0). You may get a warning from older worlds about those blocks missing.
- Requires Farseek 2.0+.
