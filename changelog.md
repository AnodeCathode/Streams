- TFC soil blocks falling in streams when _not_ using Repose are now washed away as items instead of simply disappearing, and no longer make a rock breaking sound.
- Gravity-fallen rock blocks can now replace Streams river blocks. This addresses a corner case where Streams, Repose and TFC would cause infinite re-spawn of lava-generated cobble.
- Fixed TFC Nether using wrong modded chunk provider.
- Removed Shader block replacement message when in server mode.
