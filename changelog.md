- Fixed [Streams river blocks disappearing from existing worlds when upgrading to Streams 0.4.5](https://github.com/delvr/Streams/issues/77). (Note: upgrading from 0.4.5 to 0.4.6 will restore the missing blocks but will cause some of the sloping sections to misbehave. For best results, upgrade on the Forge-created world backup instead.)
